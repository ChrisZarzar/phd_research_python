#### HISTORY ####

CREATED Chris Zarzar 20-Oct-2016:
Wrote this for Louis simply for text file management. More advance techniques
can be used if csv module is used. 

****If I do list.seek(0), this will rewind and go to the top of the list.  This is much much faster. To look for certain values, I should you list.index(<value>). This would be much faster than if then statement. I could have been an issue of not closing the files, because even if you donâ€™t store it in ram, it stores that search location on the harddrive.
